## DISCLAIMER
This is the documentation of the original Script I wrote for Laravel. Many of the things here do apply to the setup with codeigniter as well, definitely not all though. This documentation will be adapted as soon as development slows down as the name of the scripts and their content are still subject to change.

## Idea
This Project aims to simplify setting up a laravel project in a local development environment for new and experienced developers.

It stores all data (excluding the built docker image) in a single directory to make it easy for a developer to remove existing projects again and keep their system clutter-free.

The only **dependencies** for this project are **git** and **docker(-compose)**.

Tested shells are: `bash`, `zsh`

## Content
This project ships with a custom docker container based on **php:8.2-apache** with the php extensions opcache, pdo_mysql, intl, and zip.

It also includes **mysql:8** and **phpmyadmin:latest**.

## Other useful info
- To reset the Database, stop the Docker containers, go to the project root and execute `rm -rf dbdata`. Then execute `./setup`.
- The apps and PMAs port can be changed by editing the `SETUP_APP_PORT` and `SETUP_PMA_PORT` variables in `.env`. This resets after running `./setup`.

## Setup
### Windows with VSCode
- If WSL isn't installed yet, install it by executing `wsl --install` in your preferred shell.
- Open WSL from startmenu or your preferred shell by executing `wsl`.
- Open VSCode by executing `code`.
- Wait until the VSCode server is installed.
- VSCode should open up. Press F1 and use `WSL: Connect to WSL` command.
- Press F1 and use `Git: Clone` to clone this repo.
- `cd` into this repo (the laravel-setup-script directory).
- Press F1 and use `Git: Clone` again. Make sure to clone it into this repo's folder and to NOT open the cloned repository and instead click `cancel`.
- Rename your project to `laravel` by either using the `mv` command in the VSCode terminal or by right-clicking on the directory in VSCode and clicking `rename`.
- Start Docker Desktop on Windows.
- Type `./setup` into the VSCode terminal.
- Type `./start` into the VSCode terminal.
- Done!
#### Tips & Tricks
- If you encounter any Docker-related issues, it might help to close Docker Engine and stop WSL by executing `wsl -t ubuntu` in your preferred shell. After that, start both again.
- If you want to commit to your laravel repo with the VSCode F1 commands, make sure to switch to the folder your repo is in first. This can be done via `File` => `Open Folder...`

### Linux
- If you're a (sigma) Linux user, follow the Windows instructions starting from when the repo should be cloned.
- Make sure you have access to the `docker` and `docker compose` commands.
- Make sure you started the Docker Daemon; that's `rc-service docker start` for Open-RC based distros and `systemctl start docker` for Systemd based distros. If you're not sure what type of distro you're running, you probably run a Systemd based one.
